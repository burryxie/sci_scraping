**Target**: 

extracting all papers details *(title,authors, abstract, publication year,corresponding author and corresponding address)*, given journal names and a certain year period *(that is journal name, start year and end year)*

**Workflow**:
* First step: Collecting the link url of every paper, given a specific query/key words(*that is journal name, start year and end year*)
* Second step: Collecting the detailed data of each paper via looping through all the link urls derived in the first step

**Status**
* code for the second step is verified ok

**Todo**
* For query results with multiple pages, **how to get the url links for page 2, 3, ...**
